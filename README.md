Here is a rough example of building a custom Guttenberg block that loads an image carousel with prev / next buttons.

**Built using:**<br />
Underscores theme<br />
ACF

**Next steps would be:**
Finesse the layout - actually make it look nice!<br />
Use a ACF Repeater field instead of declaring image 1, image 2, image 3 etc
